Now that it's 2019 and the final episodes of Game of Thrones are coming, I
decided to go back and catch up. Two years is a long time to remember everything
that happened.

Not the entire series. Just the most recent episodes of season 7.

The main question still remains. Is that dragon breathing ice or blue fire? I
say ice.
