title: Teams Take the Shape of their Leader

Statement: Software teams take on the tendencies of their leader.

I've never realized it. But after working on several teams. Both as a leader and a team member. I have realized that these teams almost always that the shape of their leader. And it makes sense. Why wouldn't a team follow the direction of what a particular leader has found to be useful.

Now that I look back, I certainly lead developers based on my tendencies. I have certain things I favor from my experience building software, and those things certainly showed up.

For example, anyone that knows me, will know that a project I lead will be light on client side tech, and favor server side tech. In many cases, either client side or server side will work, but I prefer server side. So I'll generally push those sort of solutions.

This isn't an intentional thing. It's just a fact that when presented with a problem, we tend to reach for familiar solutions. And once you've been doing this stuff for awhile, you get a pretty large bag of tricks.


It's not a bad thing...




It could mean that the team isn't a good fit for you...




Team leaders are like football coaches....
