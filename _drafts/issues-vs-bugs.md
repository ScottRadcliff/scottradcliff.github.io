# Issues and Bugs

Thesis: Issues are not always bugs

Intro

A programmer has a certain idea in his head when he hears the word bug. 

For some programmers, it results in fear. Fear that the software they wrote doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do. Fear that others will think they are a fraud because they wrote incorrect software. Maybe it was that one corner they cut. Maybe it’s just poorly architected. All fearful thoughts and usually a  programmers with less experience.

For other programmers, it results in doubt. Is this really a bug? Doubt that the user is actually seeing a bug or just something that they don’t like. Experienced programmers call those issues. The user has an issue with the software. That doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s broken. It means that it doesn’t work as expected.

And that’s the key between an issue and a bug. The first question is *Does this work as expected?*. The second question is *Does this work as described?*.

Programmers become a bit jaded after a few years of *bugs* that are really issues. Just the word bug can put a programmer on the defensive.





What a bug in to a software user, or even a software purchaser.

What a bug actually is.

I got to thinking the other day. The way a programmer sees bugs, and the way a client or non-programmer sees bugs is not the same.

When a programmer thinks bug, he thinks broken. Something is not usable.

Often when a client thinks bug. He is thinking "this doesn't do what I expect". This doesn't always mean that the application is unusable.

There is a stark difference between issues and bugs. We should do our best to use the proper terms and to educate the people we work with.
