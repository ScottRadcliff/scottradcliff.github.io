# How to Pair Program Remotely

People that work remotely suffer from a lot of things. Loneliness and lack of help when they get stuck are just a couple of many issues they suffer from. I am a remote worker. I have been for several years. I prefer it most times. There are some obstacles to overcome. One of those being pair programming while in two separate locations.

This is how I approach pair programming as a mentor/dev lead.


## Software
I typically use ScreenHero. I have this love/hate relationship with ScreenHero. Let me be clear, screen sharing is a hard problem. A lot of variables to deal with. But... Slack bought this app a long time ago and they have done 0 improvements. It has the same bugs that it had when Slack took over. I assume this is because they are rolling that tech into Slack directly, and the calls feature proves that they are expanding. But it's still now great. But the best tool I have found that allows each developer use whatever tools they want, i.e. text editor.

I've tried some other tools. Google Hangouts is _okay_ in a pinch. Tmux can work, but you have no sound and resolution can be a problem. I still work with a MacBook Air that is not retina. Pairing via tmux with a person on a retina machine is really odd.


## Dealing with Latency
The number one issue when pairing remotely is latency. Without question. Let me just admit that I am not the best typer. I'm okay. But I do make my share of typing mistakes. Add latency on top of that and it makes me downright furious. I still struggle with this. My best advise is to slow down. Nothing worse than getting 30 characters deep and then realizing that you messed up on the 5th character.

Snippets are your friend. Hopefully your pair has a good collection of snippets that do the typing for you. Having similar environments is preferred, but can be unavoidable at times. Sometimes you just have to deal with latency.

## Using Cloud Based Tools
When latency becomes too much, I have reverted to GitHub for help. Work for 30 minutes, push your changes, then have the pair pull down the changes when it's their turn to drive. And rinse and repeat. It sounds like a lot of work, but it's not bad and it saved a ton on latency frustration.

This assumes that you both have the project installed and running in almost identical environments. If not, this would probably be more trouble that it's worth.

## Sound
Some developer claim that you should have audio and video separate. I've done this and it's okay. But using audio/video through the same channel really hasn't been much of a problem for me. Not enough of a problem to force me to handle to different channels for the same activity.
