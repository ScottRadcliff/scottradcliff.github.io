Every Thanksgiving I think about what I am supposed to think about. What I am thankful for; it's been hard wired into my brain. But this year is a little different. I truly am thankful. This Saturday, two days after Thanksgiving, we will have a house full of family members. This is the first year we are giving my parents a break. No cooking, no cleaning; just relax and enjoy their time with the rest of the family. For this, I am thankful.

My kids are growing up so fast. One of them is off to college next year, another one not far behind, and one still in middle school. My wife and I know that our days our numbered. Soon they will be off to take on the world and we will in an empty house, confused as to what we are supposed to do with the just the two of us. For now, they are still living with us and we are savoring every second. For that, I am grateful.

I have a good job doing some pretty cool stuff. I get to program with Ruby all day and I have some nice freedom and flexibility in my schedule. I really couldn't ask for more. Well, that is unless Github calls, (Yeah right!). In addition to that, I get to teach some people about how to craft web applications in the evening, and I have the freedom to alter the content to what is happening on the web _right now_, for that, I am thankful.

Happy Thanksgiving.
