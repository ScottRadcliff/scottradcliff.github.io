Every once in a while, I find a site that is way above average. A site that makes you think when you read something that is published to it. [http://swombat.com](http://swombat.com/latest) is one of those sites. I get inspired with every post I read. It reminds me of when I read [Rework](http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1324318793&sr=8-1) and I wanted to drop everything and build something.
