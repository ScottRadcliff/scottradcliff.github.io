Working in my home office this Saturday and glanced up at the self above me. Three books caught my eye. "PHP Programming with MySQL", "XML", "Programming with Visual Basic 2005", "Learning Rails", and "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide". You should immediately notice an array of languages in there. The past two years I have gotten away from playing with different languages and technologies. This is a great reminder for me that being stuck in one language is extremely crippling, just ask _the_ Cobol programmer.

One of my short term goals is to play with new languages or frameworks that I wouldn't get a chance to play with during my work day. My short list includes, [Express](http://expressjs.com/) (Node), [Spine](http://spinejs.com/), [Lua](http://www.lua.org/), and [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

It's easy to get complacent and forget to continually learn.
