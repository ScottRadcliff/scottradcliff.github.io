For all of the complaining I might do. About my job, stress, money, etc. When I sit on the back porch looking over a beautiful country setting with a cold Guinness, I know life is just about perfect. It's important for me to be reminded of just how fortunate I am.

I have a great family, a great job, my kids go to an amazing school, and I get to build software every day, all day. Life is good.
