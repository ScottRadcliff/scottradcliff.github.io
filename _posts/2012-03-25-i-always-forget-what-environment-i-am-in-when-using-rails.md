I finally got tired of making changes in the wrong environment. More often than not, when coding, I will have the production site up _and_ the dev site. I've editing the wrong one more times that I would like to admit. So I added a simple banner across the top when working in the development environment.

It's real simple.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2190678.js"> </script>

Then some simple CSS

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2190688.js"> </script>

Now I have a decent looking reminder where I am at.
