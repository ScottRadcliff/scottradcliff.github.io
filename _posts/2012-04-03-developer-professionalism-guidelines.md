This post is a reminder to me of the importance of professionalism as a developer. It's way too easy to fall into a trap of quantity and speed over quality and deliverable software. The following is a (growing) list of things that I think are important in preserving professionalism when creating software.

* Never write code until you completely understand the problem.

* Strive for zero bugs in production code.

* Plan and write your code for simplicity and future collaborators.

* Empower users to perform tasks free of developer interaction.
