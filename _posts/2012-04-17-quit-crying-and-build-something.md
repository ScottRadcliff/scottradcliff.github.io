The latest exchanges about semicolons and testing on Twitter may have done me in. I don't seem to enjoy the service as much as I once did. I can remember having the chance to meet and chat with people that I otherwise wouldn't have had the chance to. Now it's just a hotbed of crying. Everything from "_my testing process is better than yours_" to "_I'm too cool for semi colons in my JavaScrip_". What an complete waste of time, and I suspect there are many like me that just don't care what everyone else is doing.

As a reminder for those that get caught up in the processes and tools arguments, a quote from the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) (if that's your thing)

>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br>
Working software over comprehensive documentation<br>
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br>
Responding to change over following a plan

More and more, all I care about is working software. How we get there doesn't matter to me much. As long as I am confident in the code that I write, I'm happy. Sometimes that's acceptance tests with Cucumber; sometimes it's not. Sometimes it's unit tests at the model layer because the HTML and URL are unimportant; sometimes it's not. It's really, really simple. Use the best tool for job and don't worry about what Joe Programmer uses. You are ruining it for everyone else.
