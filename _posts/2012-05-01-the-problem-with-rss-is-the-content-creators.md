If there is anything that is going to kill RSS for me, it will be websites somehow resending *all* of there posts/articles. Several times I have ended up 20+ posts from one website all at once. This is the type of thing that will kill RSS, the content creators.

Oh yeah, and the '_click here to read more_' malarkey.
