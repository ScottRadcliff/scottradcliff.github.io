I need to rant a bit here. I've come across way too much _clever_ code. If your writing code that you think is clever, just stop it. Go back and make it clear. It's not clever, or cool, or creative. It just sucks and the person trying to figure out what you were thinking when you wrote it is ready to kick your ass.
