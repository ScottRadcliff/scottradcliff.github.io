I have this little voice inside my head. It's usually pretty quiet, but every so often it speaks up. It reminds me that what I'm thinking about trying *might* fail. I *might* be laughed at. People *may* talk about how stupid my idea is. I could embarrassed for years to come. The list goes on and on, and I listen.

I always listen. I start thinking "*Yeah, what a dumb idea. What was I thinking!? I can't do this!*". And that is the end of the loop. Back to beginning I go, and it starts all over again.

This little voice of doubt effects nearly all decisions I make. The end result is a stock pile of half-finished ideas. I can only get so far before this voice speaks up, I get scared and stop working on the idea. I'm too scared to succeed.

I now work just as hard trying to stop that doubt as I do on the actual product/idea. Honestly, the only reason I am working on my current project is because a lot of different people asked me about it after I mentioned it. The project was dead. I had shelved it because I was scared.

Every day I have to suppress that voice. I have to try to ignore it and just work through it. It's harder than you would think. I need to constantly remind myself that the Internet is full of haters that will always have something to say, and it will always be negative. They will always pick out the parts that I got wrong and will never offer constructive criticism about how the project may be improved.

My job is to ignore it and just go for it. This is my reminder.
