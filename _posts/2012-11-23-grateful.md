Considering it's Thanksgiving, I sat for a minute and thought about what I am thankful for. I immediately thought about my current job and how much I complain about it. I complain about it a lot, way too much.

In fact, if I'm honest, being negative is a character flaw. It's definitely something I would like to work on. I have a ton to be grateful for, including my job, but there is so much more.

If you're a software developer in 2012, you have a lot to be grateful for. You hold a skill that in the most demand and has the brightest future. You get to make stuff that really impacts the world. You can build a business with just a little business knowledge. It's awesome when you really think about it. And it will only get better.

I am thankful that I had the foresight to go learn how to build software and in the process uncover some other skills that will definitely effect my future. I am thankful for a growing community of friends that help each other build businesses and grow an awesome community (Keep an eye on Toledo Ohio). I am thankful for an amazing family that supports me unconditionally.

Now that I am all thankful and stuff, it's time to build stuff and enjoy this while it's still awesome.

Be grateful. Build things. Be happy.
