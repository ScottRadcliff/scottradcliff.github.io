In 1994, my favorite comedy of all time was released in theaters. I loved Dumb and Dumber. I laughed non-stop. I know it was stupid, but that was the genius. It was so stupid it was funny. I'll bet I laughed at the same gags the first 10 times I watched it. An instant classic.

Fast forward to 2013. Someone on Facebook posts a link to the sequel. Not just a knockoff with different actors, but an actual sequel with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. It's doomed. The  classic will be tarnished forever. There is no way they can capture what they did in the first one. Both of these actors haven't made a decent movie in years!

I say it's time we only let Pixar and Quentin Tarantino make movies. They are clearly the only people left with a creative bone in their body. No remakes (unless it's completely reimagined), very few sequels (the ones that are done, are done well. Toy Story actually got better with each sequel), and they aren't releasing movies just to make a buck.

'Dumb and Dumber to' will be a train wreck. Somebody stop the Farrelly Brothers before it's too late.
