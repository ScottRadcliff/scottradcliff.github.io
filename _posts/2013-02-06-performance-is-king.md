When all the dust settles, and all the requirements are met, and your shiny new
app with the amazing aesthetic design is deployed. The only thing that matters
is performance. No one will care how great it looks if they are stuck staring at
it while it loads. As a matter of fact, if they are like me, they will just open
another tab and forget about for app altogether.

Before you make it pretty, make it fast!
