I am looking for remote working opportunites. After a few years with my current employer, it is time for me to move on. I'm interesting in remote or contract opportunities.

I have 10 years experience building web sites/applications and 3+ years with Rails applications and Linux server administration.

If you know of a project or would like to hire me, email me at scott@scottradcliff.com
