As Seth Godin puts it:

>>  If you get more news, faster, via Twitter, say, you're not going to have a significant advantage over someone who has *just enough* news. Understanding what every single person is saying about everything, all the time, leaves you little opportunity to actually make something.

Perfect and true. Set a *data constriant* and build something.
