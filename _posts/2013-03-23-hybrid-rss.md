I'm one of the ones that love RSS and have been thinking about it a lot lately. My problem is this. I like the Reader inbox style some, and I like the river style some. I need something in between.

I'm pretty confident that there is going to be a lot happening in the RSS space. A lot of really talented people are going to use RSS in interesting ways. And some already have. But I done like anything out there right now. The newspaper style escapes me. I don't get it and I think it's a terrible way to read my RSS sources.

Here is what I would like to have:

A river of interesting things to look at and read. All of my favorite things, updated every few minutes.

A way to act on these items. Share somehow, or save for later.

And way to view all items from a source so I can still keep on my favorite sources in case I do miss something.

I am fighting the urge to build this thing. I'm hoping someone builds it first.
