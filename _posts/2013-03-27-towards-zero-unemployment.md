Once again, Seth Godin has made me think. Seriously, whether you like the guy or not, you owe it to yourself to subscribe to his blog.

He raises some good points about how employment became a *thing*

> A dozen generations ago, there was no unemployment, largely because there were no real jobs to speak of. Before the industrial revolution, the thought that you’d leave your home and go to an office or a factory was, of course, bizarre.

And what should be next

> I can’t wait until we return to zero percent unemployment, to a time when people with something to contribute (everyone)  pick themselves instead of waiting for a bureaucrat’s permission to do important work.
