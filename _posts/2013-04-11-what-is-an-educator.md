When I set out to build [Velocity](http://velocityapp.net), I had a certain vision I wanted to fulfill. I wanted to make the best software available for an educator. I know what an educator is to me, but sometimes I wonder if everyone shares my idea.

Being an educator is pretty simple. It has nothing to do with college degrees, formal training (although it does help), or age. All you need to have to be an educator is knowledge, and the desire to share that knowledge to those that don't have it.

That's it. There's no more. I could end this post right now, but that would be pretty boring.

## We are all educators
The guy that has been programming for 20 years and wants to show newbies how it's done. He's an educator.

The guy that has a associates degree from some college you never heard of, but has been working in the field for a few years. He's an educator.

Of course the guy with the multiple degrees is an educator.

But what about the guy that took a 6 month trip to Africa and learned their culture? Is he qualified to educate? Absolutely.

My point is we are opening new avenues for education. It's not always about classrooms, tuition, and professors. It can be about everyone.

If you agree with me, [sign up for Velocity](http://velocityapp.net) and we can teach someone something new in an awesome new way.
