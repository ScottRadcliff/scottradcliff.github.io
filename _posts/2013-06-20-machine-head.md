I don't know how I never got into [Machine Head](http://www.machinehead1.com/) before, but these  guys are awesome. A great metal band. If there is one thing that makes subscription services like Spotify worth it for consumers and artists, it's that once I get into a band, I can listen to all of their stuff. If it's awesome, I'll buy it.

Before Spotify this would have never happened.
