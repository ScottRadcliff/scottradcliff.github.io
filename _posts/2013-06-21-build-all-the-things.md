I am starting to think that if I have the ability to build the services I use, I owe it to myself to do that.

Services are dying all around me. They get purchased, killed, or are at risk of getting purchased or killed.

The way I see it. The only way to have awesome online services that I know are going to be there is to build them myself.

I know it's a lot of work, but seems like a good experiment and I have a pretty good [umbrella](http://10pixels.net) to build them under.
