[Jamie Zawinksi](http://www.jwz.org/about.html) has absolutely [nailed my experience](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/06/google-reader-apocalypse-extremely-fucking-nigh/) with the Google Reader apocalypse. Except for the fact that I'm okay with reading my feeds in a browser. In fact, aside from my iPhone, I prefer it.

Feedly sucks. It's difficult to use, inconsistent, and ugly. I know some people think it's *pretty*, but it's not. This is not moving the RSS platform forward. It's just keeping it level. It's the same thing. No, scratch that, it's worse. I liked Google Reader better.

That small rant about how awful Feedly is, is nothing compared to Jamie. I laughed the whole way through reading the [article](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/06/google-reader-apocalypse-extremely-fucking-nigh/). It's worth five minutes. You'll probably need readability or something similar. The site is hard on the eyes.
