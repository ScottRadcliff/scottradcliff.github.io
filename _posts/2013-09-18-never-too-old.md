Anyone that knows me knows that I am a little sensitive about my age. Not
really about getting older, but more about my profession. I see clear lines of
ageism in technology and I fear that I am quickly approaching obsolescence.

I think about it a lot. I question just about everything I do, wondering if it's
the *right* move. Worrying that I should be concentrating on something more
important so I don't fall behind current trends. When I should really just enjoy where I am and have fun
building stuff.

I was reading through [Quora](http://quora.com) today and stumbled upon
something that I found interesting. There was a question about [what people in
Silicon Valley due when they hit 35](http://www.quora.com/Silicon-Valley/What-do-people-in-Silicon-Valley-plan-to-do-once-they-hit-35-and-are-officially-over-the-hill). You know, when they are *over the hill*.

The first answer that caught my eye was from Steven Grimm.

> When I was 35 I started working at Facebook. The only hill I went over that year was when I drove to Santa Cruz to visit some college friends.

> Some of the best programmers I know are over 40. The software police don't show up at midnight on your birthday and confiscate your license to code.

I thought it was kinda funny, so I followed the question so I could see what
other people had to say.

The next answer that caught my eye was from Michael Arrington.

> I started TechCrunch when I was 35.

Then Craig Newmark.

> Well, I started craigslist when I was 42...


And finally Paul Bragiel.

> I started to train for the Olympics.  :)

That's when I knew I had to save this. I will need this the next time I think I
am too old.

*Update*

Then Reed Hastings.

> Well, started Netflix DVD rental when I was 37...and first streaming when I was 47...so maybe not too bad after 35 except that all-nighters are definitely harder.
