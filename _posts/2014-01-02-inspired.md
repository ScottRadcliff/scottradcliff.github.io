I just learned about [Jonathan Mann](http://jonathanmann.tumblr.com/) and I've lost the last hour just watching videos and reading a few [Medium posts](https://medium.com/i-stop-being-afraid-of-making-something-bad-and/f6213db2d90d). Wow.

I've played guitar for years, and have tried writing songs before. I failed every time. It's extremely difficult.

The courage it must take to just release something everyday that would take most people several days to fine tune blows my mind.
