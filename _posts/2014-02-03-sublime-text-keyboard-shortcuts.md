This is a [great list of Sublime Text keyboard shortcuts](http://csnipp.com/s/66)

Worth noting that this appears to be a Windows specific list. Replace CTRL with CMD for Mac.

Some of my most used ones are

Toggling the sidebar, in the rare case that I use it (CMD + K + B)

Searching a file or files (CMD +F or Shift + CMD + F)

Select whole word (CMD + D)

Go to anything and command pallete (CMD + P and Shift + CMD + P)
