With [37signals](http://37signals.com) announcement of the company restructure they are going through; concentrating on Basecamp and eventually getting rid of everything else, something I saw in a [Joel Spolsky Post](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html) years ago in regards to building your own tools still rings true.

Building my own tools is a theme for me this year. 37signals just reminded me how important it actually is.
