I'm trying something new today. I am using QuickTime to record myself working. I can't record all day, but I can record short bursts of an hour or so. I'm curious to see what it looks like when I am working. What types of things I may be struggling with without realizing it. And areas to optimize my workflow.

This is a two part experiment.

I am a fan of honing my skills. But I can't wrap my head around practicing things that I don't see as practical. Deliberate practice with programming puzzles seems pointless. But what if I practiced something worthwhile? Take Single Page Apps for example. I've been wanting to really dig into single page apps. I'm looking to learn as much about them as I can, and then form an educated decision as to where they sit in my workflow.

What if I build a SPA everyday. At the end of the day I delete it and start over the next day. This is similar to deliberate practice, but it feels more real to me. What types of things would I learn by recording and watching myself build these apps?

I think I will see a lot, but I have no clue what it will be. I can't wait to see how this turns out.
