I still love the fact that in Rails or Ruby, while sketching out code to get my ideas out of my head, the code that I think would be ideal is already written.

I didn't know I could call `request.query_parameters` to check for a query string until I thought that `request.fullpath.query_string?` would be ideal.

This is why programmers love Ruby and/or Rails. It fits how we think.
