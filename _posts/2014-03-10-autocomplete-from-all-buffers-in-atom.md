The more I use [Atom](https://atom.io/), the more tweaks I find I need to make. The good news is that it's pretty simple to adjust the editor. The bad news is that it's not very well documented yet.

I'm so used to searching in all open files for autocomplete, that the default Atom config frustrated me. The fix is pretty simple. Locate autocomplete in settings (Cmd-,) and check Include Completions from All Buffers.

Ahhhh, that's better.
