Do you build mobile apps of the native variety with APIs? Or do you build mobile apps that you wished had an API? If so, I would like to chat with you a bit. I have this thing floating around in my head about APIs, okay I have a lot of things floating around in my head, but only one is about APIs.

I want to hear about what frustrates you. I think I have a solution, but I need to hear from you first.

If your local, I'll buy you beer or steak or something else. I just want to pick your brain for a few minutes. If your not local, I'll buy you a beer whenever I see you. Promise.

If you're up for it, you can email me at [scott@scottradcliff.com](mailto:scott@scottradcliff.com), message me on Twitter [@scottradcliff](https://twitter.com/scottradcliff), or message me on skype scottradcliff.
