There are a few developer blogs out there that I really follow. Frankly, some of them are just boring. This one is probably included.

I love Brent Simmon's blog. His posts are often just thinking out loud. A great way to see how other developers think through problems and solutions. I wish more developers would just type what they are thinking and hit publish.

I should probably do this more.
