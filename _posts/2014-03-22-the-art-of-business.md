I have a confession to make. I actually like all the business stuff required while running a software company. I used to hate setting up meetings, chasing down leads, and all the other stuff that I have to do to make a living building software for other people. This time around it's different.

I guess I just started learning how to do it properly. It makes a huge difference in how I approach it when I know what to expect.

Here are a few of the things that I think make it more enjoyable.

Listen - When I started opening my mind to really listening to people and trying to help them with no strings attached, the conversation quality really jumped. I  stopped worrying about if I was going to get paid and concentrated on developing friendships.

Patience - Sales never close on one encounter. It could take 3 or 4 or 10. It depends. I stopped worrying about it, and started looking for ways I could help with their problems.

Be Picky - I learned I don't have to do business with everyone. Some people are a really bad fit for me and that's okay. They are looking for the cheapest labor they can find. Yes, some people see software developers as labor. Just a robot punching a keyboard. These are not the type of people I am drawn to, and when I stopped talking to them I enjoyed the art of business more.

I'm still learning, but it's more fun this time around.

Maybe failure is required the first time?
