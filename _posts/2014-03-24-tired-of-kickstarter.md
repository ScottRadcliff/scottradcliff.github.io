I'm tired of Kickstarter. It seems we, as a people, have lost the art of building something and selling it. Everything is a Kickstarter campaign.

Now, when I see some product is a Kickstarter project, I immediate lose interest and close the tab.

Show me something I can purchase.

Show me something that you created. Not an idea that may or may not turn out like I expect.
