I gave my first conference talk on May 30th at [Self Conference](http://selfconference.org).  I presented on teaching programmers. I touched on four topics.

- *Safety*. Creating a safe learning environment is huge. I went over what this means and some techniques to use.
- *Authority*. Authority is all about becoming a reliable resource. I also touched on some techniques here.
- *Collaborative Learning*. I probably spent the most time on this. It's so important.
- *Mentorship*. I closed out talking about how you continue to teach after the course is over.

It went pretty well, and I think creating an effective environment for teaching is a great topic. Something we should definitely should be talking about more.
