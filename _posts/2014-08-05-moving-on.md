For the last few years I have been working as a sole developer inside a company. It has it's perks. No one can tell me my code sucks. No one will argue with my technical decisions. But it also has it's bad side too. No one will tell me my code sucks. No one will argue with my technical decisions.

Working by yourself wears you down pretty quick. You lose something. You almost need someone to question you. That alone forces you outside of your comfort zone and helps you grow.

I have been passively looking for a new place for a few years. What I really wanted was other people to work with. People that shared my family values, desire to build awesome software, and the best work environment I could find.

I came close, but nothing felt quite right.

I have finally found that company.

I will be joining the team at [Whitelabel](http://wlabel.co).

These are some of the most talented people I have ever been around and I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to be a part of their team. I cannot wait to get started and see what we can build together.
