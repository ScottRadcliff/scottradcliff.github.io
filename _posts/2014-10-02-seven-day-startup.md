[7 Day Startup](http://wpcurve.com/the-7-day-startup/)

Dan Norris has written a free e-book on starting a business in 7 days based on his experience. How you feel about the book will probably vary based on your exposure to the startup world and/or bootstrapping businesses. There is nothing about VC or pitches. Just a game plan for worrying only about stuff that matters and how Dan approaches his business.

I had heard most of this stuff before. But I did enjoy the book and it has changed my thoughts on an upcoming project.

Hey! It's free. [Go read it](http://wpcurve.com/the-7-day-startup/).
