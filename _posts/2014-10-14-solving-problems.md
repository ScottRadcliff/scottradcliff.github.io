This is a great piece about what it means to build software. This is exactly where I am at.  Programming for programming sake doesn't excite nearly as much as it used to. Solving problems is what gets me up in the morning and excited to build software.

Yep. But I'm not totally on board with not building businesses. I think that's a part of it for me, just not the main part.

Solving problems is the main part. The most important.
