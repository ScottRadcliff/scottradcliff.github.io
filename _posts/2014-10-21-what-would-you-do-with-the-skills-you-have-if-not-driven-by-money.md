title:  What Would You Do With The Skills You Have If Not Driven By Money

I posted this to facebook yesterday. Just something that has been floating around my head lately.


There is this question that's been floating around in my head for two days. What would you do with the skills you have if not driven by money, but driven by societal change. In other words, if you could forget about money and only concentrate on touching/changing lives everyday, what would your work look like?

It's especially interesting in my field (software), where we throw millions at useless companies that provide very little value to society. What if we threw just a fraction of that to a company that really puts a dent in something real. Off the top of my head, I can think of hunger, homelessness, retraining the unemployed, domestic violence, human trafficking, and the list goes on and on.

What if you/I only worked on projects that helped improve humanity? The first issue is money. I mean we have to eat  I don't have no answer "yet", but I have the beginnings of a thought. If we can throw 55K at [potato salad](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/324283889/potato-salad), surely we can crowd fund a developer to work on nothing but software that promotes social good for a year.

To be continued...
