Last night Kobe Bryant, arguably one of the best basketball players of all time, set a [new NBA record](http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/11862042/kobe-bryant-los-angeles-lakers-sets-nba-record-missed-field-goals). **For misses**.

He has missed 13,418 times. Yet, he has 5 championships.

He has 5 championships because he doesn't know how to quit.

This was a great reminder that no matter how many times I fail or screw things up, I need to get up and try again.
