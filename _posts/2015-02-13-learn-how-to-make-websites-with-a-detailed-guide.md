I've been working on something. I've been thinking about for a few years. Right about the time I quit teaching.

I asked myself where do people go when they want to learn how to make websites, but don't know where to start?

What about people that think dev bootcamps are overkill, or think they just cost too much?

I remember what that's like. This was me about 10 years ago. I didn't know anything. I had no idea where to start. I just knew that I was ready for something new.

I was ready to change lanes and go in a different direction.

I am combining my experience learning how to, and making websites, into a guide that sets you up for success and shows exactly what you need to do to get started.

I'm calling it Changing Lanes: a step by step guide on learning how to make websites.

You'll learn.

1) An introduction into web design and development.
2) An introduction to Web Standards. What they are and why they are important.
3) How to find answers to your questions. Where to go and how to ask for help.
4) How to separate presentation, structure, and behavior for your website.
5) A brief overview of HTML. How it works, how to write it, and where to find more information.
6) A brief overview of CSS. How it works, how to write it, and where to find more information.
7) A brief overview of JavaScript. How it works, how to write it, and where to find more information.

The book will sell for $10. But I am offering a pre-sale for $5 with a sample chapter included.

If you buy the book now, you will get the sample chapter in PDF form on how to ask questions and an overview of how browsers work, and the complete book in PDF on Monday with all updates to come after that.
