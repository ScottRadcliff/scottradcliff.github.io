It’s no secret that I have an issue with Startups. Not the idea of startups, but the community around startups. The whole thing is based on *getting a hit*. Building something you don’t care about to get rich. In it’s essence, the majority of the startup scene is equal to a giant get rich quick scheme. And if you’re a developer, it’s more like a pyramid scheme and you are at the bottom doing the work and getting the least reward. Unless of course, it’s a hit. Then you get climb up the pyramid and be a cherished success story.

Business, at it’s core is not that hard.

Here it is, in it’s simplest form.

Find a market

Discover what that market wants/needs

Build what that market wants/needs

Sell the product

You don’t need some stupid [vocabulary](http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/15/how-to-speak-startup/). You don’t need follow some stupid community that is run by billionaires that want to capitalize on your skills. All you need is a problem to solve that is worth paying for and the skills to solve it.
