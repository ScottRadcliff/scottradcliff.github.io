I will be presenting at [self.conference](http://selfconference.org/) on May 29-30. Not sure about the time slot yet.

I’ve been working on 100% remote team for about six months, and it’s been unlike any remote team I have been on before. Some things have worked well for us, and many things have not.

I will be presenting on what we have learned about [working remote](http://selfconference.org/sessions#session_37). Some things you can try, what types of things you want to avoid, and some tips to help make your team a little tighter when you are all spread out.

Hope to see you there!
