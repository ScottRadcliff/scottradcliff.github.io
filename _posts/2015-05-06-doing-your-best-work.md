title:  Doing Your Best Work

I’ve been thinking a lot about doing my best work. I ask myself questions like *If I didn’t get paid, would I still do what I do everyday* and *What would it feel like to be immensely proud of what I’ve done*

This really has nothing to do with employers, clients, or friends. Most of the time, what they hire/ask me to work on is important to them. But not necessarily the most important thing to me.

Recently, I was asked what the most important thing is to me regarding work. Without hesitation I stated that building software that changed someone’s life. Something that didn’t used to exist, but now does, serves a *real* purpose, and allows a person to do something that they couldn’t do before was the most important thing.

You can take everything else away. Money, pool tables, cool offices, work when I want, or anything else. Once you reach a certain point, none of those perks matter. And this is what money driven people don’t get. Not everyone cares about being rich. Some people just want to leave a legacy, a body of work that meant something. You can’t buy that.

So, I thought to myself. What are some good examples of this. This is by no means a complete list, but here are some examples of people changing lives through software.
