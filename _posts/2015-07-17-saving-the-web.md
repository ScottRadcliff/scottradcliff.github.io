I just read a superb article on [Medium](https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426). That's quite ironic after you read the piece.

In it, Hossein Derakhshan talks about the web we lost. Which seems to pop up every couple of months. I have to admit I'm intrigued every time I see one of these. They all make great points. We did lose something when we all got _social_.

Hossein is right. I used to start my day in an RSS reader checking up on what was happening. I now start on Twitter or Facebook. I'm kinda ashamed about that. I do love the open web and wonder if we are on the cusp of some sort of, err I don't know, revolution. One where those that are capable give those that are incapable the ability to host stuff on the internet free from censorship or any sort of silo.

I don't know what this might look like. Certainly not _web rings_. Please. Do not start web rings again.

I imagine some sort of RSS or JSON would be involved and give people a way to share information without limitations.

Certainly something to think about if you are technical enough to run servers and build software to empower people.
