Every once in a while something comes along on mobile and I am just absolutely blown away. It's just one of those uses of tech that you start to wonder what's possible and where it could possibly end up.

Seriously. Stop what you are doing and go get [Google Spotlight Stories](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/23/9023411/spotlight-stories-ios-google-releases). It's amazing!

The app puts you right in the center of a movie and physically move around to see what is happening.

The first thing I did was download the movie Help. It's a pretty large file and takes a while. But once you watch it, you'll know why.

It's a completely immersive watching experience. I was literally spinning in my chair trying to look at everything.

The coolest part is you will hear or see things happening behind you and try to turn around to see what is happening.

This app is seriously cool.
