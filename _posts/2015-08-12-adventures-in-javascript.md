Today I started to take JavaScript back. I started taking a bunch of jQuery code and convert it to plain old JavaScript. I discovered a few things.

1) There are functions in the JavaScript API that I don’t remember before I started using jQuery. `querySelector` is pure awesomeness.

2) Client side code is fun again. I am not programming *in* a language anymore, but *into* a language. (if that doesn’t make sense to you, drop everything and read Code Complete). My thoughts and overall design are at a much higher level, and I am having a lot of fun discovering that the language already supports a lot of what I want to do.
