I often think about doing something cool and talk myself out of it. Lately it's been some sort of screencast site where I teach some programming thing. Nothing big. Just small things. Maybe once a week. I would need a library of videos built up before.  That's where I get derailed. All this thinking and planning. And then. I do nothing. Over and over again. I do nothing.
