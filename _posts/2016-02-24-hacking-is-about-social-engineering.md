title: Hacking is All About Social Engineering

In college, I took a lot of electives that had to do with networking and other topics that didn't have a lot to do with programming. In one class I was given the option to read [Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of Kevin Mitnick by the Man Who Did It](http://www.amazon.com/Takedown-Pursuit-Capture-Kevin-Mitnick/dp/0786862106/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1456366044&sr=8-6&keywords=Takedown). A book about the most prolific hacker in history. I quickly realized that hacking has less to do with computers and more to do with humans. Through [Social Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)), a person can you your own tendencies and the faults of humans to gain access to what they need to get to your stuff.

If you haven't read about Kevin Mitnick, and are interested in how people get hacked, read that book. If you want a quick look into how Social Engineering works, watch this video.
