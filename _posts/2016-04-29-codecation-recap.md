I thought writing down some thoughts everyday would be easier. I'm always wrong, but I still try.

That's not what this is about. It's about [codecation](http://scottradcliff.com/codecation.html). I haven't had any updates. So I wanted to list what I planned on doing, and what I actually did.

What I thought I would do:

1. Journal via this site everyday. All the things that were going on, with some images and possibly videos.
2. Finish my side project to a point where I could ship upon returning.

What I actually did:

1. I did recorded some stuff in the notes app on my iPhone, but I didn't write or blog anything. However, I did share a bunch on Instagram. So maybe I get like a half of a point.

2. I did not finish the side project. I did make some progress, and I am super close, but not ready. I failed. I underestimated spending two days at a conference and exploring a great city I had not been to before. No regrets. I still had a great time.


If I ever do a codecation again, I would make a couple of changes.

1. I would not try to wrap it around a conference. Especially one as cool as [Deconstruct](http://deconstructconf.com/).
2. I would have more structure. I spent a lot of time during the day walking around and exploring. I would have like two days planned to get to know the area, and then dedicate days to working and nights for play for the remainder of the time.
3. I might have more people. Not sure if this is good or bad. I think it _could_ bring some accountability, but I think it could be added distractions.
4. As awesome as Seattle is (I would love to move there), it was really far. I might go some place closer. At a minimum, I would add a shopping day for groceries to cut down on costs and the need to go out for food.
