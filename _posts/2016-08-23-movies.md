title:  Making Movies. Sort of.

If you are a programmer, you might have heard that you should have a hobby that is not programming. I’ve always said mine was playing guitar. But if I’m honest, I don’t play that much anymore. I still play around here and there, but not nothing serious.

I’ve been watching Casey Neistat videos recently. I’ve really fell in love with his stuff. So much so that I think I’ve been inspired to try some sort of film making. Not full blown movies with actors and scripts, but short videos of some sort. It seems like it would be fun.

A few ideas.

- A documentary of the making of a web app from start to finish. A behind the scenes look at what it takes to make an app.

- Some sort of a _Day in the Life of a Developer_ series.

I know nothing about film making. I’ve done a small bit of reading. I tried to record some footage and then edit it yesterday. I learned that it’s really hard. Like really, really hard.

I’m currently playing with stories on Snapchat and Instagram. This gives me the freedom to play around with scenes and different things with the overhead of editing and such, while I learn some concepts. I suck pretty bad right now, but that’s the fun part. I get be a newb for a while.

You should say hi over there.
