Continuing with the *I think I want to make videos* era has me thinking of a new constraint. 

Not only could I use stories on Instagram and Snapchat. I could limit any videos to only iPhone created content. 

I think this forces me to not get fancy.  Just think about what I want to record, record it, arrange it, and post it. 

So far I've learned that less is definitely better. I created something way smaller today. And I think I can go even smaller tomorrow to make it better. 

Oh, and I ordered a tripod for my iPhone. Shaky video has been a problem. Short and steady.
