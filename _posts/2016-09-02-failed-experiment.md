I’ve been inspired by [Jennifer Dewalt](https://jenniferdewalt.com/) and her quest to learn how to make websites that resulted in 180 websites in 180 days.

That’s an **epic** achievement. 

I wondered how this could be applied to programming? Could I create a new program/application everyday for 30 days? Not even 180. Just 30. I got my answer. NOPE.

The first day was easy enough. A simple [Pomodoro App](https://github.com/ScottRadcliff/pomodoro). I actually thought I could do this. Day one was pretty simple. Well… day two… not so much. I could make some progress, but I couldn’t finish something everyday. Not and have it worthwhile or interesting.

So I failed.

That’s okay. 

Regroup and try something else.

So now I am trying to just program something for fun everyday. A couple of rules.

1. It cannot be *work*. Meaning it can’t be a work project, or something I have to do for my job. Even though that stuff can be fun too.

2. It cannot be a startup, business, or for money. This changes my mindset. I think about these differently. When I mix these, the projects always fail.

We will see how this goes.
