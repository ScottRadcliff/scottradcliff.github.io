I've wanted to go on a [codecation](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/you-should-take-a-codecation) since I first heard about it a couple years ago. It's a great idea. A couple of developers holed up in a new location and a new place (probably an AirBNB) with no distractions. Just an laptop and a product to build or code to write. I'm finally getting my chance and I'm pretty sure it's going to be awesome!

When a friend and I heard about Gary Bernhardt's [Deconstruct Conf](http://deconstructconf.com/), we immediately knew we were interested in going. I hadn't really considered a codecation type of thing. But when you surround yourself with brilliant people, they think of things for you. And so, we decided on an amazing conference in Seattle and mini vacation to blast out some code.

I have a project that I have been trying to ship. Like for a long time. Because I suck at finishing. That's what I will be working on for about four days. It's a product around hiring and recruiting for tech companies. Codename: Rockstar Ninja. Again, the name was not my idea, but an idea from the same dude that said _Hey! Let's take a codecation._

I plan on recording some parts of the trip. Not sure what I will do with it yet, but hopefully something interesting.
