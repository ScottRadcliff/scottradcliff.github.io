I may be a little too excited. It's the month of my codecation and I've been counting down the days on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottradcliff/status/848540576651849728). I imagine this may get annoying for some people, but it does a couple of things for me.

1. Help remind me to hang in there. I almost have a vacation. It's been several years since I've had an actual vacation. The last time I had a _vacation_ was when my daughter was graduating from bootcamp for the Marines in Parris Island, S.C. -- Not sure that qualifies as a vacation, but that's those closest this I have in about 4-5 years. I'm ready!

2. Remind me that I have work to do before April 19th gets here. I have a lot of pre-work to do before we leave. Some last minute travel details, but more importantly, I need to get my side project in a place that is good for me to finish it. This includes hangover days.

With roughly four weeks until codecation is over and I need to ship, here is my loose schedule for my project. Disclaimer: I'm about 80% done, but not happy. I decided to go back and wireframe the entire thing so I can get a good plan for finishing. I never did that at the beginning. I just hacked some stuff together.

Week One - Wireframing Done.

Week Two - Remove stupid design that is in place now. It's garbage.

Week Three - Build graph. The app I am building has graphs for some commit data.

Week Four - Billing stuff and launch!
