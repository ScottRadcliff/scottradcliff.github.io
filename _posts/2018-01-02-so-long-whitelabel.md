title: So Long Whitelabel, It's Been Fun

After three years, it's time for the next chapter. I am no longer at Whitelabel and have started on my next adventure. 

I enjoyed my time at Whitelabel. There are some really great people there doing some really great work. I learned a lot while I was there. I learned about myself, what I enjoy, where I want to be, and I learned a lot about where I don't want to be, and what I don't enjoy.

I am an opinionated software developer. After several years of building software, I have defined opinions about what it's purpose is and of what the end result should be.

In the end Whitelabel and I wanted different things. The company was going down a path that I wasn't interested in going down. 

Going forward I'd like to continue the work that I was doing at Whitelabel. Teaching, mentoring, and delivering great software.

I have a few things I am working on, and actively looking for other opportunities. If you love building great software for great people, and believe in people over profits, I'd love to talk to you.
