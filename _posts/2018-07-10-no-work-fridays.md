title: No Work Fridays

I don’t work on Fridays. Well, mostly. I may do a little work in the morning. An hour or two. But typically, I take Fridays off.

I’m working a contract right now that allows me to have my agreed upon hours in by the end of the day Thursday.

This has turned into a day for my wife and I. It started as just me sitting around watching Netflix. Like your typical fat lazy slob. But the last few weeks, Linda has had some stuff for us to do.

I now look forward to these days. Family has always been super important to me, and when software developers are always on and seem to be always working, this is a great way to spend some family time and disconnect.

Super grateful. Four day work weeks are the best.
