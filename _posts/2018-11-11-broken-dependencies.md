title: Broken Dependencies
date: 2018-11-11

One of the most frustrating things in building apps are things you can't control, like an external API, breaking your app. A broken production app is the worst. A dependency you can't control breaking and then causing havoc for customers is clearly worse than a developer pulling his hair out because something isn't working the way it should. But a broken dependency in development feels like the equivalent of slow internet versus no internet.

I would rather the whole things be broken than have the feature all set except for an external dependency that isn't working.

I guess the fix is to make sure there is always a fall back option you control for development.
