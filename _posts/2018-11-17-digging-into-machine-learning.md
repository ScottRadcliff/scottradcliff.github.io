title: Digging into Machine Learning
date: 2018-11-17

Since [RockstarNinja](/rockstar-ninja.html) has an AI element to it, I've decided to really dig into parts of AI. Primarily machine learning. I've dabbled a bit and I do understand the basics, but I decided to dig a little deeper.

I know that video courses are really popular, but I still feel that if you really want to learn something, you just can't go wrong with an in depth book. I decided on [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XNKV5TS/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o00_?ie=UTF8&psc=1). So far, it seems really good. Through the first chapter, I've learned a few things even though it's just a general overview of machine learning.

Looking forward to sharing what I learn as I work my way through.
