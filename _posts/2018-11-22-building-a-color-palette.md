title: Building a Color Palette
date: 2018-11-22

Steve Schoger has a book coming out called [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book/) and it looks like it's going to be awesome. He just released a teaser for [building a color palette](https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/). I've read quite a bit about color palettes, and while I'm not a designer, I have taken some design courses and I did win 2nd place  in design competition for a Led Zeppelin collage (humble brag).

Also, if you are interested in UI design and have not seem the [Refactoring UI videos](https://www.youtube.com/steveschoger)  , stop everything and go watch them.
