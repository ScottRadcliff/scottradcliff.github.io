title: A More Balanced Internet
date: 2018-12-08

The problem with the news that IE is going to a Chromium browser is that the
things that Google is doing, or trying to do (require SSL on all sites, favor
AMP) gets worse. When they own market share, or even worse almost total
dominance, nothing stops them from attempting even more of these types of
things.


This is the main reason why choice is a good thing. I like Firefox and I think
I'm going back to that to help support a more balanced internet.
