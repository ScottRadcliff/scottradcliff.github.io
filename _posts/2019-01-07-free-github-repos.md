Today Github announced [free private repositories](https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/) for all accounts. This seems like good news on the surface. And I generally agree that free private repositories for up to three collaborators is a good plan. Good for students, small projects, prototypes, etc...


What I fear is that we just became the product, and that Microsoft did this in attempt to grow as large as it possibly can. Imagine what a company that makes software and services could do with the largest collection of developers on the planet. I hope that's pessimistic and only good things come from this.
