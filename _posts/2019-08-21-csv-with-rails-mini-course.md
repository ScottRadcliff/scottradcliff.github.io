title: CSV with Rails Mini Course
date: 2019-08-21
---

After years of talking about getting back into teaching, I've finally released something. I'm calling it a mini course. It's a course on how to handle importing CSV data into a Rails application. 

The timing of releasing it is nothing more than just being sick of not having something out there. I decided to make something small, iterate on it, and build something from there.

It contains four videos and covers:

* How to upload a CSV file in a form
* How to parse the content of the file
* How to map the cells to attributes of a Rails model

It also contains all the source code used in the example as a full Rails app. It's not Rails 6 though, I was almost done by the time Rails 6 was released. That could be an update.

It's selling for $5 as an introductory price. I plan on adding a lot of stuff to it. As I do, the price will go up, but you will get all the updates for free regardless of what price point you came in at.

If you have purchased it, thank you! If you are on the fence, feel free to [email me](mailto://scott@scottradcliff.com) with any questions you have.
