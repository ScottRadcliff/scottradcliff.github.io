title: Elixir Saved My Career

Sounds a bit bold, and maybe an overreaction, but I think it's true. Without Elixir, I was thinking of doing something else.

I've been pretty vocal about my distaste for the current state of front-end development. And I was getting to a point that if front-end dev was the future of software development, I wasn't interested. I was pretty close to just calling in quits and doing something else.

Then I got recruited, started a new gig, started doing Elixir seriously, and developed a new love for making software again.

I sure hope things like Elixir are the future of programming. And keep in mind, if you don't like a particular portion of software development, you can just concentrate on something else. Regardless of what someone else tells you.
