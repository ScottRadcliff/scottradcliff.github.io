I've been learning and studying music theory for about three years. I've played instruments for years, dating back to the clarinet in fourth grade. But have concentrated on guitar since about thirteen years old. I took lessons for a few years, but didn't really get into the theory of it until recently.

I love it. It sort of reminds me of the early days of programming for me. Lots to learn, lots to play with, and with each new thing I want to learn even more.

I plan on writing about guitar and music theory a bunch, but wanted to drop one thing here. I've decided to start each day with writing music. Doesn't have to be long, and arguably won't be very good for a while. But I want to work on getting something recorded, mixed, and mastered.

Here is day one (Sort of. I've written some other things, but this is the first day of the new thing.)
