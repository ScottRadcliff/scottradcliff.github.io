A couple of weeks ago while gushing over my love of Derek Trucks and the Tedeschi Trucks Band, a friend suggested Maggie Rose to me. So I found her latest release, and almost instantly fell in love with her voice for one, but it's really her band. They are top notch. The guitars are dynamic and subtle in the best ways. Often you can't even hear certain parts of the keys or bass, but they are there. I know that sounds kinda bad, but it's not. Everything blends so well together.

Here is a YouTube video of _Saint_. It's wonderful. Seriously worth checking out.
