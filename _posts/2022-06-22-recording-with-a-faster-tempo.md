title: Recording With a Faster Tempo

Whenever I write and record music, it always seems to fall into a familiar place. About 70bpm, kinda slow and somewhat melodic. To switch it up, I decided to increase the temp and see what happens.

I played on everything except the drums. 

The bass guitar was fun. I hadn't touched a bass in about three years. I really like the movement of the bass line. Not too much, but still adds some flavor.

I kinda hated the drums I created inside Logic. I did some editing, and this feels better.

There is also a little lead guitar section at the end that I left out when I bounced the track. I didn't really like. 

I learned a bit about levels. Usually I try to record, just short of clipping. In the yellow mostly. But my guitar tone is usually pretty mellow. I did the same thing this time, but I really needed to reduce the volume on the guitar tracks. Not sure why. Maybe mic placement or the new amp. This is the first recording with the Vox AC15.
