I love the 2 5 1 jazz progression. It's just such a great sound. But I'm not a great jazz player. I have this one progression that I like to noodle around with in the key of C. Dm G7 Cmaj7 with some other things mixed in.

I built a pretty short track. Just an A section and B section and played some melody over it. I [break down the music theory at the 5:40 mark](https://youtu.be/AFGMOqDy4V0?t=340)
