  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>I am a freelance software developer in Northwest Ohio. I've been working with Ruby and Rails for the last 8 years, but cut my teeth on PHP and a bit of Perl.</p>

  <p>My latest gig was leading the engineering team at Whitelabel Collaborative in Toledo Ohio.</p>
  
  <p>Right now, I am working on making hiring developers better, building applications on Blockchain technology, and working as a freelance developer to help people build out really cool projects. If you have a project, <a href="mailto:scott@scottradcliff.com">we should talk</a>.</p>
  
  <p>I believe in:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Software for the greater good</li>
    <li>People over profits (profits will come if you treat people well)</li>
    <li>Family first</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/scottradcliff">Github</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/scottradcliff">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram/scottradcliffagain">Instagram</a>, or just <a href="mailto:scott@scottradcliff.com">email me at scott@scottradcliff.com</a>.</p>
