  <h2>Bio</h2>

  <p>I'm a software engineer that currently works in Elixir. And has for about 3-4 years. It's great language!</p>

  <p>Prior to that, I worked in Ruby for about 8 years. I still love Ruby. I just haven't touched it in awhile.</p>

  <p>And before that, it was PHP.</p>

  <p>In my opinion, the best part of software engineering is the software design. Not in huge documents, but it thoughtful preparation about what the system does, how it reacts to other systems, what are unacceptable inputs, how does it handle those inputs, and so on...</p>

  <p>Over the past year, I've become fond of methods of observability. Thinking through what events in the software are good indicators that it's working as intended. And how do you view those. And of course, how do we know when something has gone wrong. Thinking through and implementing those tools has had a huge benefit to know that you built acts like you expect it to.</p>

  <p>On the personal side, a happily married father of three. I love all the nerd things; Star Wars, Marvel, Lord of the Rings, Video games. I'm a hopeless Miami Dolphins fan. And lastly, a huge lover all things guitar. I've played for many years, and love going deep on music theory and the more technical aspects of how music works.</p>
