Hi, I'm Scott, and I'm really bad at writing bios. I'll do my best not to bore you with some sort of resume web page thing. Or some sort of silly webpage of useless facts about me. I will try to guess why you are here. I assume it's one of maybe two reasons.

1. You came across me through a social network and became curious.
2. You found me while looking for a software developer that does what I do.

I'll attempt to address those two things. If you are here for a reason that is not one of those two, I'm super interested in what that is. Would you mind contacting me and telling me what that third thing is?

## What I care about.
A reasonable place to start is to briefly touch on the things I care about.
