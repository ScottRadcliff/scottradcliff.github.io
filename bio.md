I am a freelance software developer in Northwest Ohio. I've been working with Ruby and Rails for the last 8 years, but cut my teeth on PHP and a bit of Perl.

My latest gig was leading the engineering team at Whitelabel Collaborative in Toledo Ohio.

Right now, I am working on making hiring developers better, building applications on Blockchain technology, and working as a freelance developer to help people build out really cool projects. If you have a project, <a href="mailto:scott@scottradcliff.com">we should talk</a>.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/scottradcliff), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottradcliff), [Instagram](https://instagram/scottradcliffagain), or just <a href="mailto:scott@scottradcliff.com">email me at scott@scottradcliff.com</a>.
