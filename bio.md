My story isn't the typical programmer story. I wasn't hacking on computers building my own games when I was 6. I wasn't even building my own games when I was 11 or 13. Looking back now, I always loved computers and was intruiged by them, but we didn't have one when I was growing up.

It wasn't until I had already grown up and worked for several years before I started messing with computers and trying to figure out how things worked.

I worked as an Ironworker for 13 years before I had some pretty lengthy layoffs. I decided I wanted to know how websites worked, bought some books, and started to play with creating my own websites. Of course, they were completely awful as I taught myself.

Eventually, I started to get into programming. I found it much more difficult than I imagined.

Considering I had a family to support, I had a decision to make. Either 1) stop playing with websites becuase I had hit my limit, or 2) Go back to school and really learn the down and dirty details about how websites work.

I opted for two, enrolled in school, and discovered I was pretty good with programming. It came pretty easy to me.

While I was there, I helped many of my fellow classmates learn the finer details of programming, and eventually was asked to return and teach. I ended up graduating and teaching for three years before I decided it was time to move on.

These days, I spend my time thinking about the next evolution of education and how my skills fit into that. I really do love the thrill of teaching someone something.

## Personal Life

I have three kids that keep me very busy.

Zach got me back into guitar a few years back and I spend a lot my free time playing one of the guitars we have, when I'm not programming.
