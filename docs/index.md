Message: Welcome, look at my stuff

Hi. Hello. Hola. I suppose this is where I say "Welcome to my website, blah blah blah" or "Scott Radcliff is a developer and blah blah blah". I doubt that's why you are here. I think you here probably because you are looking for something I wrote or did. Maybe you heard about me and googled my name.

Hey. I'm Scott. I don't know who you are. But if you email me I will. That would be awesome.

I'm a software developer that thinks software should change lives[link]. I mean, really. Don't we have enough social networks and clones of other successful apps. We can do better.

I'm also a Dad. A very proud one. Oh. And I play guitar. And I love metal. And I don't like country music or techno. And I love beer. And I realize this sentence is ridiculous. And I love Apple. And I like football and basketball. And I don't care what text editor you use. And I like to rhyme, And I like my beats funky. And I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy.
