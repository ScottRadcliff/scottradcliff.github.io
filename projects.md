# Random Password Generator
Once upon a time while starting to play with Node, I wanted to see what was involved with creating an NPM package. I came up with the idea of a random password generator and built it as an NPM package. I haven't touched it since I wrote expect to add on pull request. It may be useful for you. If so, feel free to download and use it.

`npm install random-password-generator`

Using it is really simple.


    var generator = require('random-password-generator');  
    generator.generate();  
    #=> qkqtuflq

# Schema Parser
I dislike reports. I dislike reports a lot. A whole lot. I started to write a library that would search throw the schema file in a Rails app and build a form that contained every model and and their attributes with data types. I never finished it. And I'm not even sure it's the right solution, but if you need something to build from that has started parsing the schema, feel free to grab it and go. I haven't touched it in a very long time.
